Revision history for Perl extension Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie

0.03 
        - refactored make_session_cookie to separate calc_expiry, and made
	      that easily overloadable.
        - updated for the new state API (get_session_id, set_session_id, etc)

0.02    2005-12-28 13:51:00
        - Fixed cookie_expires to support browser session cookies.
        - Renamed default cookie name from just 'session' to
          'yourapp_session' to allow several applications on the same domain
          to exist without conflict (LTJake)

0.01    2005-11-14 12:45:00
        - Initial release.
