NAME
    Catalyst::Plugin::Session::State::Cookie - Maintain session IDs using
    cookies.

SYNOPSIS
        use Catalyst qw/Session Session::State::Cookie Session::Store::Foo/;

DESCRIPTION
    In order for Catalyst::Plugin::Session to work the session ID needs to
    be stored on the client, and the session data needs to be stored on the
    server.

    This plugin stores the session ID on the client using the cookie
    mechanism.

METHODS
    make_session_cookie
        Returns a hash reference with the default values for new cookies.

    update_session_cookie $hash_ref
        Sets the cookie based on "cookie_name" in the response object.

    calc_expiry
    calculate_session_cookie_expires
    cookie_is_rejecting
    delete_session_id
    extend_session_id
    get_session_cookie
    get_session_id
    set_session_id

EXTENDED METHODS
    prepare_cookies
        Will restore if an appropriate cookie is found.

    finalize_cookies
        Will set a cookie called "session" if it doesn't exist or if it's
        value is not the current session id.

    setup_session
        Will set the "cookie_name" parameter to it's default value if it
        isn't set.

CONFIGURATION
    cookie_name
        The name of the cookie to store (defaults to
        "Catalyst::Utils::apprefix($c) . '_session'").

    cookie_domain
        The name of the domain to store in the cookie (defaults to current
        host)

    cookie_expires
        Number of seconds from now you want to elapse before cookie will
        expire. Set to 0 to create a session cookie, ie one which will die
        when the user's browser is shut down.

    cookie_secure
        If this attribute set true, the cookie will only be sent via HTTPS.

    cookie_path
        The path of the request url where cookie should be baked.

CAVEATS
    Sessions have to be created before the first write to be saved. For
    example:

            sub action : Local {
                    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
                    $c->res->write("foo");
                    $c->session( ... );
                    ...
            }

    Will cause a session ID to not be set, because by the time a session is
    actually created the headers have already been sent to the client.
